Thanks for downloading this free asset.
I really hope you'll like it !


But WARNING ! Really important :
To have the appropriate rendering, YOU HAVE TO set "Project Settings/Player/Color Space" to LINEAR.

In the demo scene, you will find an example script witch use Magical Rock program interface to switch between its two states : magically green and normal.
This activates or deactivates according materials, animations, diamond light and sound fx (wich is triggered by the diamond light animation).

The prefab is ready to use.
But of course you can create your own personnalized one using the models, animations and sfx.


Have fun ! :)
